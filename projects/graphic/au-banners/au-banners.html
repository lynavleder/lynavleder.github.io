          <p>These are a few of the 75+ course banners I've made for Athabasca University. For this design process, I had to read the syllabus and course material and do enough research to start to understand the overarching ideas present in the course, then put that into a visual representation.</p>

            <h3>COMP 272: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
            <p>What came up more than once in my research of data systems was the comparison of data systems to trees, where there is a main system (the trunk of the tree) and many branches that go out from there but are always connected to the trunk. After learning about algorithms, I learned that the metaphor of a tree also works quite well to describe algorithms. Algorithms can be described in a simlar manner, although there isn't always a body or trunk like in data systems, algorithms do branch like trees. Algorithms have a starting point that then branches out to accomodate all of the possibilities for choices, like a choice tree. Because of how well the visual metaphor fit for both subjects of this course, I decided to make a "digital tree" to represent both the structure of data systems as well as the branching choices that are characteristic of algorithms.</p>

            <h3>COMP 314 - Operating Systems</h3>
            <p>For this banner, I chose to highlight that the course has to do with operating systems. Operating systems are the go-between for the computer hardware and the user. Users interact with a GUI interface, which in turn translates into commands for the computer. Because the end result is more or less the interaction between a human user and a computer's hardware, I wanted to highlight some pieces of computer hardware and place them in a setting that suggested careful process and deep understanding of computer components--a blueprint. What this is meant to convey is that through this course, students will gain a deep understanding of the components that drive a computer system. I chose to add some grain and texture in the background to increase visual interest while hopefully not distracting from the main message.</p>

            <h3>COMP361: Systems Analysis and Design</h3>
            <p>From my research, Systems Analysis and Design is about gathering information, doing research, and creating a system that is efficient and cohesive based on the needs outlined in your research. I chose to represent this by having two seperate areas of colour--a "before" and an "after", so to speak. On the "before"/left side, there is a representation of disorder and chaos, and on the "after"/right side, the information has been gathered and sorted and placed in an orderly and cohesive manner. I feel this is a good visual representation of Systems Analysis and Design because it portrays the idea of organizing and streamlining a process or information.</p>

            <h3>COMP 410: Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>Software engineering is a field that often involves many many people working on individual aspects of a project. This is why I feel that cogs working in tandem are a good representation of this process--seperate, but each part essential. From the cogs, strands or branches representing code and the software are coming. This is meant to represent the outcome of the team engineering software. The two ideas mix and create something unlike either.</p>

            <p>This banner is meant to convey the concept of designing real-time software in depicting a blueprint-style sketch of a bullet train—a technologically advanced machine that relies on real-time software—as well as some computer code to reinforce the role of computing and coding in the process as a whole.</p>

            <p>This banner has three wireframe illustrations of different generations of computers: the Commodore 64, an original Mac, and a current-day Mac. In my research, I read about this course presenting foundational knowledge and theory, so I thought the wireframes would be an appropriate representation. The idea behind using wireframes instead of photos is that I wanted to convey the idea of structure (skeleton) that is present in this course.</p>
